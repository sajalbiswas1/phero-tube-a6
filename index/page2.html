            <div class="pl-5">
                <p class="font-normal "><span class="text-2xl">Ans:</span> The scope is the current context of execution
                    in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not
                    in the current scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so
                    that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
    
                    JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:
    
                    Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
                    Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
                    Function scope: The scope created with a function.
                    In addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an additional scope:
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value.
                    const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value.
                    developers shouldn't use var anymore. They should use let or const instead.
                    if you're not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use const.
                    The first two points are likely pretty self-explanatory. But what about why we shouldn't use var, or
                    when to use let vs const? As we go through this tutorial, hopefully this will all make sense to you.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-14">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
            <div class="pl-5">
                <p class="font-normal "><span class="text-2xl">Ans:</span> Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the meaning of null in programming.

Null is basically an assignment value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.

When we assign null as a value to any variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to null.

            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-14">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
            <div class="pl-5">
                <p class="font-normal "><span class="text-2xl">Ans:</span>A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.  

                    In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill the request. 
                    
                    You can think of an API as a mediator between the users or clients and the resources or web services they want to get. It’s also a way for an organization to share resources and information while maintaining security, control, and authentication—determining who gets access to what. 
                    
                    Another advantage of an API is that you don’t have to know the specifics of caching—how your resource is retrieved or where it comes from.
